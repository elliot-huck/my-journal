		<h3>Monday, May 21st</h3>
		<p>First day of class! I'm in Cohort 26. I'm really glad I learned terminal and installed everything ahead of time. It would be cool if they had a prework app with everything broken down into 2-hour pieces, maybe ordered in a tree? Perhaps I can eventually build something to do that...
